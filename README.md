Pamagsalin Download - Docker Deployment Guide
This guide provides instructions on how to run the Pamagsalin Download application using the provided Docker image file. This method ensures the application runs correctly without needing to install Node.js or any other dependencies.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, you must have Docker Desktop installed and running on your computer.

Download Docker Desktop

## How to Run the Application
Follow these steps to load the Docker image and start the application container.

### Step 1: Load the Image
First, make sure you have unzipped the shared file to get the pamagsalin-download.tar file. Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal on Mac/Linux), navigate to the directory containing this .tar file, and run the following command:

Bash

# This command loads the application image into Docker
docker load -i pamagsalin-download.tar
This will load the image onto your local machine, making it available to run.

### Step 2: Run the Container
Once the image is loaded, you can start the application with a single command.

Bash

# This command starts the container and maps port 8080
docker run -p 3000:80 pamagsalin_download
This command does two things:

It creates a new container from the pamagsalin_download image.

It maps port 3000 on your computer to the application's port 80 inside the container.

### Step 3: Access the Application
The application is now running! 

Open your web browser and navigate to the following URL:

http://localhost:3000

You should see the Pamagsalin Download application running live.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
